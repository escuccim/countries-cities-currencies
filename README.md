# countries-cities-currencies
SQL scripts to create and populate linked tables of countries, cities, currencies and languages. 

List of languages and currencies is not complete. There is a language id for each country - many countries have multiple languages, in this case I just picked one for each country.

The data comes from various sources, I have just collated and imported the data and created foreign keys to link the tables to each other.
